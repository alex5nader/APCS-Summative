# Pearman's Adventures in the Infinite Plane of Existence
### Pearman's Adventures
**Pearman's Adventures** is an endless runner game where the player can switch between 3 lanes and destroy or dodge oncoming obstacles. There is a small chance that any incoming obstacle will become a coin, which gives points, or a power up, which can either help or hinder the player. The game slowly speeds up over 1.5 minutes, after which it reaches its max speed.
